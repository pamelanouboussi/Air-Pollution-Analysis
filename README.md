# Air-Pollution-Level-Analysis
## Project Title: Analysis of Air Pollution Levels
### Project Description
This project aims to explore the variance in the annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels across different years and regions, using statistical analysis and data visualization. The primary goal is to examine the changes in air pollution over time and investigate if these changes vary significantly across different geographical regions.

### The hypotheses being tested are:

The annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels have changed significantly over the years.
The annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels vary significantly across different regions/countries.
Data
The dataset used for this project contains annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 air pollution levels for various regions and countries over multiple years.

### Key data fields include:

Region
Country
Year
PM10 Annual mean
PM2.5 Annual mean
Methods
The main methods used for analysis include ANOVA and Tukey HSD test for hypothesis testing and regression analysis to study the relationship between air pollution and year. Data visualization tools used include scatter plots, box plots, heat maps, and geographical maps.

### Tools
The project heavily utilizes Python programming language, along with libraries such as pandas, numpy and statsmodels for data cleaning, analysis and testing. Visualizations are created using Tableau Public, a powerful tool for creating interactive data visualizations.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Ambient Air Quality Database, WHO, April 2018.
It contains information on the annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels in various regions and countries over several years.
